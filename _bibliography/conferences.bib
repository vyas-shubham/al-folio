  abstract={Space robotics applications, such as Active Space Debris Removal (ASDR), require representative testing before launch. A commonly used approach to emulate the microgravity environment in space is air-bearing based platforms on flat-floors, such as the European Space Agency's Orbital Robotics and GNC Lab (ORGL). This work proposes a control architecture for a floating platform at the ORGL, equipped with eight solenoid-valve-based thrusters and one reaction wheel. The control architecture consists of two main components: a trajectory planner that finds optimal trajectories connecting two states and a trajectory follower that follows any physically feasible trajectory. The controller is first evaluated within an introduced simulation, achieving a 100 percent success rate at finding and following trajectories to the origin within a Monte-Carlo test. Individual trajectories are also successfully followed by the physical system. In this work, we showcase the ability of the controller to reject disturbances and follow a straight-line trajectory within tens of centimeters.},

  abstract={The recent increase in yearly spacecraft launches and the high number of planned launches have raised questions about maintaining accessibility to space for all interested parties. A key to sustaining the future of space-flight is the ability to service malfunctioning - and actively remove dysfunctional spacecraft from orbit. Robotic platforms that autonomously perform these tasks are a topic of ongoing research and thus must undergo thorough testing before launch. For representative system-level testing, the European Space Agency (ESA) uses, among other things, the Orbital Robotics and GNC Lab (ORGL), a flat-floor facility where air-bearing based platforms exhibit free-floating behavior in three Degrees of Freedom (DoF). This work introduces a representative simulation of a free-floating platform in the testing environment and a software framework for controller development. Finally, this work proposes a controller within that framework for finding and following optimal trajectories between arbitrary states, which is evaluated in simulation and reality.},

  abstract={Musical dancing is an ubiquitous phenomenon in the human society. Providing robots the ability to dance has the potential to make the human robot co-existence more acceptable in our society. Hence, dancing robots have generated a considerable research interest in the recent years. In this paper, we present a novel formalization of robot dancing as planning and control of optimally timed actions based on beat timings and additional features extracted from the music. We showcase the use of this formulation in three different variations: with input of human expert choreography, imitation of a predefined choreography, and automated generation of a novel choreography. Our method has been validated on four different musical pieces, both in simulation and on a real robot, using the upper-body humanoid robot RH5 Manus.},

Similar to industrial applications, the assembly process relies on robotic systems capable of assembling modular elements to form a complex structure. However, the in-space assembly provides exceptional challenges necessitat- ing innovation in fields such as free-floating manipulation and autonomous robotics.

abstract = {In space robots, coupling between the base and the arms causes the floating base to translate and rotate when the arms execute a maneuver, which is typically not seen in earth based robots. Since it is difficult to test developments in space robotics primarily due to the high cost and lack of access to robots in space, it is necessary to have physical systems that can mimic space conditions for experimental validation on earth. Among several options, the use of air bearings to build floating-base robots is one of the most effective. We describe the development of one such system that replicates zero gravity conditions for planar robots. Although similar systems exist elsewhere, the planar dual-arm space robot we have built is distinctive by being relatively lightweight, compact and modular. The setup can be used to test a wide range of experiments such as visual servoing, reactionless maneuvering and object grasping in space. In this paper, the approach taken during the development of both the hardware and software for the experimental setup are discussed. A few results obtained by numerical simulations as well as experimentation are also presented.},
