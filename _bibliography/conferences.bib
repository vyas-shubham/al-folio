  abstract      = {Space robots have been suggested as a prime candidate for On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions. In this paper, we present the results of employing LQR-based controllers for various free-floating robotic systems. LQR-based controllers have been used frequently as they provide an optimal controller for linear systems. Previous work has shown that the LQR controller for the linearized equations of motion for free-floating robots without gravity is globally asymptotically stable and locally optimal. The linearized equations of motion for 3 different systems are presented along with results from experiments for fixed-point stabilization and trajectory tracking. These systems vary between having continuous actuation using propellers, and binary-pulsed thrusters, along with either a single floating rigid body or a multi-body floating system. LQR controllers allow for trajectory tracking during different phases of OOS or ADR missions. Along with trajectory stabilization, recent works have demonstrated the estimation of the Region of Attraction (RoA) of such controllers for trajectory stabilization. This can be used in the future for sequential controller composition of controllers to guarantee stability through phase transitions. Furthermore, the estimated RoA allows for quick go/no-go decision-making during operations when unaccounted/unmodelled disturbances are observed.},

  abstract      = {For planetary robotics autonomous prospecting, robust, long-term navigation becomes crucial. The goal of the research project PerSim is to develop technology to address some of the challenges of active perception for resource identification and long-term navigation strategies in an integrated architecture. The fist assessment addressed autonomous selection of regions for inspection, combined arm-base approach, close range data acquisition and categorization of the acquired spectral data using Deep Learning. Furthermore, autonomous navigation including potential failure prediction and avoidance are also scoped. The following targets are pursued in the second assessment: an internal simulation to enhance the system safety and provide means for autonomous on- board safe testing, an episodic memory representation to serve as basis for the implementation of long term adaptation and finally a repertoire of behaviors to enable different motion modalities. The paper provides insights on the approaches and initial results.},

  abstract      = {This work develops a first Model Predictive Controller for ESA's 3-dof free-floating platform. The challenges of the platform are the on/off thrusters, which cannot be actuated continuously and which are subject to certain timing constraints. This work compares penalty-term, Linear Complimentarity Constraints, and classical Mixed Integer formulations in order to develop a controller that natively handles binary inputs. Furthermore, linear constraints are proposed which enforce the timing constraints. Only the Mixed Integer formulation turns out to work sufficiently. Hence, this work develops a new Mixed Integer Model Predictive Controller on the decoupled model of the platform. Feasibility analysis and simulation results show that for a short enough prediction horizon, this controller can (sub)optimally stabilize and control the system under consideration of the constraints in real-time.},

A commonly used approach to emulate the microgravity environment in space is air-bearing based platforms on flat-floors, such as the European Space Agency's Orbital Robotics and GNC Lab (ORGL). This work proposes a control architecture for a floating platform at the ORGL, equipped with eight solenoid-valve-based thrusters and one reaction wheel. The control architecture consists of two main components: a trajectory planner that finds optimal trajectories connecting two states and a trajectory follower that follows any physically feasible trajectory. The controller is first evaluated within an introduced simulation, achieving a 100 percent success rate at finding and following trajectories to the origin within a Monte-Carlo test. Individual trajectories are also successfully followed by the physical system. In this work, we showcase the ability of the controller to reject disturbances and follow a straight-line trajectory within tens of centimeters.},

A key to sustaining the future of space-flight is the ability to service malfunctioning - and actively remove dysfunctional spacecraft from orbit. Robotic platforms that autonomously perform these tasks are a topic of ongoing research and thus must undergo thorough testing before launch. For representative system-level testing, the European Space Agency (ESA) uses, among other things, the Orbital Robotics and GNC Lab (ORGL), a flat-floor facility where air-bearing based platforms exhibit free-floating behavior in three Degrees of Freedom (DoF). This work introduces a representative simulation of a free-floating platform in the testing environment and a software framework for controller development. Finally, this work proposes a controller within that framework for finding and following optimal trajectories between arbitrary states, which is evaluated in simulation and reality.},

Providing robots the ability to dance has the potential to make the human robot co-existence more acceptable in our society. Hence, dancing robots have generated a considerable research interest in the recent years. In this paper, we present a novel formalization of robot dancing as planning and control of optimally timed actions based on beat timings and additional features extracted from the music. We showcase the use of this formulation in three different variations: with input of human expert choreography, imitation of a predefined choreography, and automated generation of a novel choreography. Our method has been validated on four different musical pieces, both in simulation and on a real robot, using the upper-body humanoid robot RH5 Manus.},

  address     = {Berlin, Germany},
  abstract    = {Quaternions are commonly used for rotation representation as they avoid the singularities found in the Euler angles representation and are more compact than using rotation matrices (for storage, operations, and constraints required). However, it is difficult to use quaternions in linear control approaches due to the inherent unit length constraint of the representation. Quaternion-based linear control has been previously used for single rigid body control such as quadrotors and satellite attitude control. In this paper, we provide an analytical method for linearizing multibody freefloating robotic systems without gravity using a quaternion-based rotation representation for the floating base. This linearization is then used for deriving a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) based controller. The LQR is optimal in the local neighbourhood of the linearization and is globally asymptotically stable for such systems. The utility of this method is demonstrated using two examples from different robotic domains: space and underwater robotics.},

  abstract    = {In space robots, coupling between the base and the arms causes the floating base to translate and rotate when the arms execute a maneuver, which is typically not seen in earth based robots. Since it is difficult to test developments in space robotics primarily due to the high cost and lack of access to robots in space, it is necessary to have physical systems that can mimic space conditions for experimental validation on earth. Among several options, the use of air bearings to build floating-base robots is one of the most effective. We describe the development of one such system that replicates zero gravity conditions for planar robots. Although similar systems exist elsewhere, the planar dual-arm space robot we have built is distinctive by being relatively lightweight, compact and modular. The setup can be used to test a wide range of experiments such as visual servoing, reactionless maneuvering and object grasping in space. In this paper, the approach taken during the development of both the hardware and software for the experimental setup are discussed. A few results obtained by numerical simulations as well as experimentation are also presented.},
