  abstract={Brachiation is a dynamic, coordinated swinging maneuver of body and arms used by monkeys and apes to move between branches. As a unique underactuated mode of locomotion, it is interesting to study from a robotics perspective since it can broaden the deployment scenarios for humanoids and animaloids. While several brachiating robots of varying complexity have been proposed in the past, this letter presents the simplest possible prototype of a brachiation robot, using only a single actuator and unactuated grippers. The novel passive gripper design allows it to snap on and release from monkey bars, while guaranteeing well defined start and end poses of the swing. The brachiation behavior is realized in three different ways, using trajectory optimization via direct collocation and stabilization by a model-based time-varying linear quadratic regulator (TVLQR) or model-free proportional derivative (PD) control, as well as by a reinforcement learning (RL) based control policy. The three control schemes are compared in terms of robustness to disturbances, mass uncertainty, and energy consumption. The system design and controllers have been open-sourced. Due to its minimal and open design, the system can serve as a canonical underactuated platform for education and research.},

abstract = {Recent spacecraft collisions with debris and various near misses have highlighted the need for pursuing Active Debris Removal (ADR) of space debris. Robotic manipulators provide a versatile way to capture, detumble, and eventually deorbit the debris. This paper explores the classification of space debris and robotic manipulators based on angular momentum. Previous classifications have considered the tumble rates, size, and orbit of the debris. However, a momentum-based classification gives an additional insight into the method selection for debris removal as shown in this paper. A study on the momentum capture capabilities of previously flown robotic manipulators is performed. This gives an impression of the capabilities of the flight-heritage robotic manipulators for their use in ADR missions. Furthermore, an analysis is also performed on the momentum of cylindrical space debris as it closely represents the spent rocket upper stages which could be prime targets for a robotic ADR mission. The change in momentum due to the tumble rate and inertia is analysed for such cylindrical debris and they are then categorized based on their momentum. These analyses provide the data required to perform a matching of the momentum of the debris with the momentum capabilities of the existing robotic manipulators and thus classify the debris based on momentum. The classification is then applied to real debris objects and the results are discussed. The comparison of the momentum of debris and manipulators is also used to provide input for future manipulator development for ADR missions.}

abstract = {Recent increase in space debris combined with the increase in the number of satellites launched has created an increased risk of collisions. The effects of the increased risk can be seen in the form of an increased number of near misses in recent years. The use of robotic manipulators has been suggested for Active Debris Removal (ADR) to reduce the risk of potential future collisions that generate more debris in the orbits around Earth. Compared to other ADR methods, robotic manipulators provide increased versatility as they can be reused for On-Orbit Servicing as well as On-Orbit Assembly missions. A robotic ADR operation consists of three phases: Approach, Capture, and Detumble. This paper provides a method for performing feedback-based stabilization of post-capture detumble trajectories of the chaser-debris system. The approach presented here uses Time-Varying Linear Quadratic Regulator (TVLQR) for stabilization along the detumble trajectory. The contributions of this paper are as follows: A quaternion-based linearization method for multibody systems with a free-floating base, TVLQR for stabilizing the optimal detumble trajectory, and a probabilistic Region of Attraction analysis of the resulting closed-loop system. The estimated Region of Attraction could serve as the goal for the capture controller thus allowing for controller composition through ADR phases while guaranteeing stability and successful detumble.},
